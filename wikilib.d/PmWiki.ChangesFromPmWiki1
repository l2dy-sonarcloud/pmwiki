text=This page is intended to describe features of PmWiki 1.0 that have been changed or eliminated in PmWiki 2.0.  For now this page will be maintained a simple list and will probably need some restructuring later.²²* Double brackets are used for all links, including [@[[free links]]@].  Providing alternate text for a link is performed using either a vertical brace  [@[[PageName | link text]]@] or an arrow [@[[link text -> PageName]]@].  See LinkSyntax.²²* The $BrowseReplacements, $DoubleBrackets, and $InlineReplacements arrays are no longer used -- see [[custom markup]].²²* [@?action=post@] no longer exists -- posting a new page is now performed by using [@?action=edit@] with the [@post@] control set to a true value.²²* $WikiWordPagePathFmt is now $PagePathFmt, which is applied to all links not qualified by a group.²²²
