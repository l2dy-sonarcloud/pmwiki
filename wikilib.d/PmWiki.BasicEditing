text=The pages on this site are [[WikiWikiWeb]] pages, which means that pages can be created and edited by multiple authors.  To edit a page, simply click on the '''Edit Page''' link that exists somewhere on the page (usually in the header or footer somewhere).  Some pages may be [[password(s)]]-protected, depending on how others have configured the security on the system, but many WikiWikiWeb systems allow open editing of all pages.²²The rules for basic page editing are fairly simple--start each line without spaces and put a blank line between paragraphs.  Four or more hyphens at the beginning of a line produces a horizontal line on the page.  Asterisks at the beginning of lines produce bullet lists.  There are more [[text formatting rules]] for lists and other specialized text, if you want to do that. ²²If you want to experiment with editing a page, try the [[Main/WikiSandbox]].  You can edit the [[Main/WikiSandbox]] without affecting anything important on this site.²²%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
