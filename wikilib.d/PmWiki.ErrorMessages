If you can tell us which version, we can trace the line number to the code.  Alternatively, you can try upgrading to the latest version. see [[PmWiki/Installation]] for the current files & upgrade links.  It's possible the bug was already fixed.²²Also, double check your config.php file -- maybe something is wrong there which is being processed by pmwiki.php.²²Second warning -- this can be ignored in this case -- the 2nd warning was created because the first warning sent output to the browser before pmwiki sent all it's header information to the browser.  Had the first error not happened, the second error wouldn't have.²²----²Q: still have this pb after  ?action=attr ²²'''also I move pmwiki at root ?'''²²[[<<]]'''Warning: Unknown: open'''[[<<]]('''/var/www/free.fr/c/0/pm/sessions/sess_0597f2bc9aa5cac005a89f00e4'''[[<<]]'''0bff8e, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in Unknown '''[[<<]]'''on line 0'''²²[[<<]]'''Warning: Unknown: Failed to write session data (files).

I set the permissions of the wiki dir to 777 and then I try to run.
