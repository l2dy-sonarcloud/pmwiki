text=(:title Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):)²²This page tries to answer the more common questions you might want answered.²Many of the answers refer you to other pages for details.²²For frequently requested features, see the [[(PITS:)PITS]] pages.²²²>>faq<<²²Q: How do I get my question answered?²A: The quickest and best way is to join the pmwiki-users [[Mailing List(s)]] and post your question there. If it really is a frequently-asked question, it will eventually be added to this page.²²An alternative way is to leave your question on the [[(PmWiki:)Questions]] page.²²²Q: What does warning message or error message "xxxxx" mean?²A: Error/warning questions and answers are on the [[Error Messages]] page.²²²Q: How and why do I use the [[Site/EditForm]] feature?²A: This feature allows an admin to customize PmWiki's edit window. It is  active by default in PmWiki version 2 beta 44 or later. Some [[Cookbook:Skins]] customize the $PageEditFmt variable which overrides the edit form, making it inoperative.²²²Q: How do I use passwd-formatted files (like .htpasswd) for authentication?²A: See [[Cookbook.AuthUser]] and [[Cookbook.UserAuth]]²²²Q: Where can I get help with PmWiki? (This is a pretty vague question!)²A: See this FAQ, [[Troubleshooting]], [[Error Messages]], or try a [[Site/Search]].²²²Q: I'm getting a lot of spam on my wiki site.  How can I password protect the pages?²A: See [[PmWiki.Security]]²²²Q: How do I create nice tables similar to Product X?  ²A: See [[Advanced Tables]]. Also check [[Simple Tables]] and [[Simple Tables2]].  ²²²Q: Why are '`RecentChanges', '`AllRecentChanges', '`RecentUploads', '`AllRecentUploads' editable?²A: You might want to edit these pages if a spammer creates a page with an unsavory name. To prevent others from editing these pages, insert the following lines into your ''local/config.php'' file. Editing then requires the admin password.²²[@²## Require admin password to edit RecentChanges (etc.) pages.²if ($action=='edit'²  && preg_match('/\\.(All)?Recent(Changes|Uploads)$/',²  $pagename)) { $DefaultPasswords['edit'] = '*'; }²@]²²²Q: How do I include special characters on my wiki pages?²A: Use character codes to insert special characters, such as Copyright (&#169;) and Trademark (&#174; or &#8482;) symbols, that don't appear on your keyboard. See [[Special Characters]].²²²Q: Is it possible to move wiki.d to /tmp/persistent/wiki.d (a new sourceforge rule)?²A: Sourceforge suggest moving everything to /tmp/persistent/new-folder-of-your-choice and creating a soft link to the new folder on /tmp . It works. See [[Cookbook:SourceForgeServers]]²²²Q: How do I set one Header for all pages/groups?²A: Add the following to config.php² [=²$GroupHeaderFmt .= "Wikicode or text here";=]²²²Q: How do I insert RSS news feeds in PmWiki?²A: See [[Cookbook:RssFeedDisplay]].²²²Q: How do I change the Wiki's default name in the upper left corner of the Main Page.²A: Put the following config.php² [=²$WikiTitle = 'My Wiki Site';=]²²This appears in the sample-config.php file in the PmWiki distribution.  Copy sample-config.php as "config.php" in your local/ directory and edit it.²²²Q: How do I customize the CSS styling of my PmWiki layout?[[#customcss]]²A: See [[LayoutBasics#modifyskin]] for how to modify the default PmWiki skin.  See also [[Cookbook:Skins]], where you will find pre-made templates you can use to customize the appearance of your site.  You can also create a file called local.css in the pub/css/ directory and add CSS selectors there (this file gets automatically loaded if it exists), or add them in your local ''local/config.php'' file by inserting something similar to:² [=²$HTMLStylesFmt[] = '²  .foo { color:blue; }';=]²²²Q: How do I insert pictures on wiki pages?²A: See [[PmWiki/Images]].²²²Q: How do I link to an uploaded file from another group?²A: Use [@Attach:Groupname/filename.ext@]²²²Q: Is it possible to link an image on PmWiki without using a fully qualified URL?²A: Yes. The general format is [=Attach:GroupName/filename.ext=].²²²Q: How do I change the font or background color of the hints block on the Edit Page?²A: Add a CSS style to pub/css/local.css: [@.quickref {background:...; color:... }@]. The hints are provided by the [[Site.EditQuickReference]] page, which is in the PmWiki or Site wikigroup.  Edit that page, and change the "bgcolor" or specify the font "color" to get the contrast you need.²²²Q: How do I make pmwiki.php the default page for a website?  Should I rename pmwiki.php to index.php?²A: Renaming pmwiki.php is not recommended. Instead, create an ''index.php'' file that contains the single line:² [=²<?php include_once('pmwiki.php');=]²²You may also want to check [[Cookbook:CleanUrls]].²²²Q: When I upload a file, how do I make the link look like "file.doc" instead of "Attach:file.doc"?²A: Use parentheses, as in [@[[(Attach:)file.doc]]@].  You can make a configuration change that eliminates the [@Attach:@] -- see [[Cookbook:AttachLinks]].²²²Q: There seems to be a default password.  What is it? [[#pwlocked]]²A: There isn't any valid password until you set one.  See [[PasswordsAdmin]] for how to set an admin password.²²PmWiki comes "out of the box" with²$DefaultPasswords['admin'] set to '*'.   This doesn't mean the password²is an asterisk, it means that default admin password has to be²something that encrypts to an asterisk.  Since it's impossible for the²crypt() function to ever return a 1-character encrypted value, the admin²password is effectively locked until the admin sets one in config.php.²²²Q: How can I embed PmWiki pages inside a web page?²A: Source them through a PHP page, or place them in a frame.²²²Q: Why does pmwiki.org appear to have a directory structure rather than "?n=pagename" in [=URLs=]?²A: Pmwiki.org uses [[Cookbook:CleanUrls]].²²²Q: Can I remove items from the wikilib.d folder on my site?²A: Yes, the files in ''wikilib.d/'' can be safely removed.  They'll reappear again when you upgrade, however.  There's a permanent fix that can be done in a local configuration file (to be written soon in the cookbook).  You may find it sufficient to leave the pages there and exclude wiki-related pages from searches.²²²Q: How do I exclude wiki-related pages from searches?²Try the following in your ''local/config.php file''.  See also [[Cookbook:SearchPatterns]].²²[@²## Exclude Certain pages / groups from search results.²$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!\\.(All)?Recent(Changes|Uploads)$!';²$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!\\.Group(Print)?Header$!';²$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!^Site\\.!';²$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!^PmWiki\\.!';²@]²²²Q: How do I place a string of 10 tildes (~) onto a page?²A: To get [=~~=][=~~=][=~~=][=~~=][=~~=], use the following markup:² [=²[=~~=]=][=[=~~=]=][=[=~~=]=][=[=~~=]=][=[=~~=]=]²²²Q: How do I put a link that will open as a new window?²A: Use the [=%newwin%=] wikistyle, as in:²(:markup:) [=%newwin%http://www.example.com/=]²²²Q: How do I place a mailing address in a page?²A: Use the [@mailto:@] markup, as in²(:markup:) [=[[mailto:myaddress@example.com]]=]²or²(:markup:) [=[[mailto:myaddress@example.com | myaddress@example.com]]=]²²²Q: How do I make a WikiWord link to an external page instead of a WikiPage?²A: Use link markup.  There are two formats:²(:markup:) [=[[http://www.example.com/ | WikiWord]]=]²or²(:markup:) [=[[WikiWord -> http://www.example.com/]]=]
