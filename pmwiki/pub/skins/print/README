This directory contains the files to print pages in PmWiki for ?action=print.
This is a template just like any other layout skin, except that for
?action=print PmWiki looks for print.tmpl instead of screen.tmpl.

==>Don't edit these files directly, as you may lose your edits the
next time you upgrade PmWiki!

Instead, copy the files to another directory in pub/skins/ and edit
them there.  You can then configure PmWiki to use your modified layout
files by setting $PrintSkinFmt to the name of the directory you created 
in pub/skins.  For example, if you copy your custom print skin to 
pub/skins/custom, then you would set
   $PrintSkinFmt = 'custom';
in local/config.php.

The files in this directory:
    print.tmpl    -- the default template for ?action=print
    print.css     -- the print template's css
