This directory contains the files to control the default layout for
"Printable View" of pages.

==>Don't edit these files directly, as you may lose your edits the
next time you upgrade PmWiki!

Instead, copy the files to another directory in pub/skins/ and edit
them there.  You can then configure PmWiki to use your modified layout
files by setting
   $PrintTemplateFmt = 'pub/skins/yourdir/yourfile.tmpl';
in local/config.php.  See PmWiki.LayoutBasics for more details.
